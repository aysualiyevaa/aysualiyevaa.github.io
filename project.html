            <h1>Aims</h1>
            <p>Global leaders in the implementation of renewable energy strategies are considered to be Nordic countries, which are relevant to explore the path to achieve sustainable energy. The main aim of this project is based on analysing development of renewable energy taken by 4 Nordic countries, which are Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. The essential purpose is to compare and analyse how the four countries developed the patterns for various sectors of renewable energy, how adopted renewable energy policies in recent years have affected the energy consumption patterns, employment in this sector, EV sales, trend for greenhouse gas emissions, and whether the GDP rate affects the research and development spending on renewable energy sector. </p>

                        The data for electricity production of two sectors were scraped from the IEA dataset website through API links. Afterward, the obtained "csv" file was uploaded to Github, where raw link was acquired to use in Vega-lite for chart generation.
                       
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The patterns for renewable energy sector outweigh the trend for non-renewables for more than 10 years in both Norway and Sweden with slight changes in electricity production. Although generated electricity from non-renewables was higher in 2010 in both Denmark and Finland, electricity production from renewables is more than that of non-renewables in 2024 for both countries.

                    <p>
                        As can be seen not only the amount of electricity production increased for more than 10 years, but also the progress becomes visible as the number of renewable energy sources rose for each country over the years. The main development is noticed in the generation of energy from the wind power for all countries.

                        Similar to previous chart, although the amount of CO2 emissions decreased overtime for Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, it has been stable over time in Norway, where the emissions have been around 42 Mt since 2000.

                        The chart was generated in Vega-lite with the raw link acquired from the manually written “csv” file. Additional source was International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), which is an intergovernmental organization that also publishes statistics on renewable energy capacities of countries.

                    <p>
                        As can be seen, there is positive association between the number of female managers in energy sector and renewable energy employment. The highest pattern for renewable energy employment and number of female managers in 2023 is shown for Sweden.

            <h1> Challenges</h1>
            <p> One of the problems was with IEA website; the data was only provided on number of female managers in energy sector, which limits to focus specifically on renewable energy sector. Furthermore, some data on IEA was available on monthly basis; as I aimed to analyse on annual basis, to avoid confusion on the chart generation, I scraped the data only for January. Also, the only available data in IRENA was for 2023 year, and obtaining data was possible via either excel downloading or manually extracting data into separate excel sheet, which was done by me. API link only provided data on trend for global renewable energy employment.</p>        </section>

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p> Maintenance of energy systems through the adoption of renewable energy policies has been the main focus of Nordic countries. The main development was noticed in the increased electricity production from wind source for 4 countries. Compared to other countries, Norway displayed less progress for the last 10 years as the patterns did not change substantially for renewable consumption and CO2 emissions. Surprisingly, it illustrated the lowest rate for renewable energy employment in 2023 as well. However, the analysis shows that for more than 10 years, there has been progress in the implementation of renewable energy in those countries as most of electricity production comes from renewable energy nowadays.
