            Analysis of Renewable Energy Patterns and Their Impacts in 4 Nordic Countries

            <h1>Aims</h1>
            <p>Maintaining sustainable development has been one of the crucial challenges that each country in the world deals with. One of the widely taken approaches is to focus on the promotion of energy systems with less environmental damage through the adoption of renewable energy policies. Global leaders in the implementation of renewable energy strategies are considered to be Nordic countries, which are relevant to explore the path to achieve sustainable energy. For this reason, the main aim of this project is based on analysing the relevant renewable energy strategies taken by 4 Nordic countries, which are Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. The essential purpose is to compare and analyse how adopted renewable energy policies in recent years have affected the energy consumption patterns, employment of population in this sector, trend for greenhouse gas emissions, and whether the GDP rate affects the research and development spending on renewable energy sector. The project also aims to compare how the four countries target the patterns for various sectors of renewable energy, such as solar, wind, hydropower, etc., and reflect on whether the evolution of renewable and non-renewable energy electricity production differs substantially among the four countries.</p>

            <h1>The Data and Challenges</h1>
            <p> The majority of the utilized data was taken from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and WorldBank. Most of the data is updated on monthly and annual basis, focused on various aspects of energy policies adopted by countries, and provided data either through excel direct downloads, table generation, or illustrated charts. Majority of the data was scraped and merged to get it in combined dataset as “csv” file via Google Colab with the help of the extracted API links through “Inspect” function; I used the relevant URL codes of each country on Google Colab, which allowed me to scrape through the API. While some of the “csv" files were uploaded to Github through which raw link was taken to generate charts via Vega Lite, some of the charts were generated in Google Colab itself after looping. Relevant link of Colab files are allocated in the explanation of the charts. However, one of the problems with IEA website was that the data was only provided on number of female managers in energy sector, which limits to focus specifically on renewable energy sector. Furthermore, some data on IEA was available on monthly basis; as I aimed to analyse on annual basis, to avoid confusion on the chart generation, I scraped the data only for January. International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) was also taken as a source for data extraction, which is an intergovernmental organization that also publishes statistics on renewable energy capacities of countries. However, the only available data was for 2023 year, and obtaining data was possible via either excel downloading or manually extracting data into separate excel sheet. API link only provided data on trend for global renewable energy employment.</p>        </section>

Afterward, the obtained "csv" file was uploaded for Github, through which raw link was acquired to use in Vega-lite for chart generation.

            <h1>Conclusion (TO BE UPDATED)</h1>
            <p> The patterns for renewable energy sector outweigh the trend for non-renewables for more than 10 years in both Norway and Sweden with slight changes in electricity production. Although generated electricity from non-renewables was higher in 2010 in both Denmark and Finland, electricity production from renewables is more than that of non-renewables in 2024 for both countries. 
                2. As can be seen not only the amount of electricity production increases for more than 10 years, but also the progress becomes visible as the number of renewable energy sources rise for each country over the years. The main development is noticed in the generation of energy from the wind power for all countries. 
                
                3. While the renewable energy consumption increased from 2000 onwards for Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, there has not been significant change for Norway. 
                
                4. Similar to previous chart, although the amount of CO2 emissions decreased overtime for Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, it has been stable over time in Norway, where the emissions have been around 42 Mt sicne 2000. 
                5. As can be seen the increase in GDP in USD is associated positively with increase in R&D spending on renewable energy sector for 4 Nordic countries. 
                
                6. As can be seen, there is positive association between the number of female managers in energy sector and renewable energy employment. The highest pattern for renewable energy employment in 2023 is shown for Sweden, which has less population that that of Norway. Norway (population analyse)
                                         While the data for consumption taken from WorldBank was scraped on Colab (Colab1), data on electric vehicles (cars) sales was obtained from IAE and scraped on Colab (Colab2) as well. The acquired “csv” files were merged on Colab3, and the scatter plot was also acquired in this Colab.
